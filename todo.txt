change colour of body to blue

upload 3 images into assets

Give div.pic1 a background image

Create variable for div.pic1

Check console.log(picture); shows

Allocate screen width to div.pic1

remove width from div.pic1 css

I've found away to update the CSS width on reload

Now all I need to do is make the width change as the window grows and shrinks

I've done it!

I made the mistake of writing...

window.onresize(findWindowSize())

This wasn't working the way I wanted it to. Instead this worked as desired.

window.onresize = findWindowSize;
